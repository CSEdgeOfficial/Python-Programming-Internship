mage Compression:

Developed a Python program for compressing images while maintaining quality by exploring compression techniques like RLE and DCT and allowing  users to adjust compression quality, support various image formats, and provide output options. Optionally, include a user interface.
This Python script utilizes the Boston housing dataset to perform linear regression. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, it trains a linear regression model on the training data and evaluates its performance on both sets. It calculates the model's scores for training and testing data. Additionally, it visualizes the residuals, highlighting discrepancies between predicted and actual values. This analysis aids in assessing the model's fit and identifying potential areas for improvement, crucial for understanding predictive accuracy and model effectiveness in real-world applications.
