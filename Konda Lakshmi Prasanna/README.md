Data Analysis with Pandas:

In the program on loading  the "Iris" dataset from Seaborn and analyzing it using Pandas and performed exploratory data analysis, cleaning, aggregation, visualizations, and correlation calculations.
The output of the program will consits of calculations , graph which will be more understanding to users.


This Python script uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize the Iris dataset. It first loads the dataset and displays its first few rows and summary statistics. Then, it checks for missing values. Visualization includes a pairplot showcasing relationships between variables, a boxplot for distribution comparison, and histograms for individual variable distributions. Finally, it generates a correlation heatmap to illustrate the correlation between numeric features. These visualizations provide insights into the dataset's structure, distributions, and inter-variable relationships, aiding in exploratory data analysis and pattern recognition.
