**TASK -1 : IMAGE CONVERTER**
    
    A program that accepts images in multiple formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF) and converts them into a desired format using Python Imaging Library (PIL).

**TASK-2: DATA ANALYSIS WITH PANDAS**

    A program that loads the "Iris" dataset from Seaborn and analyze it using Pandas. Perform exploratory data analysis, cleaning, aggregation, visualizations, and correlation calculations.

**TASK-3: LINEAR REGRESSION WITH SCIKIT-LEARN**

    A program apply linear regression to predict house prices from the Boston housing dataset using scikit-learn. Compare train and test scores and plot residuals

**TASK-4: IMAGE COMPRESSION**

    Developed a Python tool for compressing images while maintaining quality. Explore compression techniques like RLE and DCT. Allow users to adjust compression quality, support various image formats, and provide output options. Optionally, include a user interface. Ensure code modularity, performance optimization, and test with diverse images, along with comprehensive documentation.
