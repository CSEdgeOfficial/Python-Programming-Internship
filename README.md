- Keep your code organized, modular, and easy to read.
- Comment your solutions thoroughly, explaining how they work and why you made certain decisions.
- Save your finished work in appropriately labeled folders under your named folder.
- Send the entire collection of source codes, along with necessary instructions, to your designated mentor via a share link on GitHub.

Evaluation Criteria
-------------------

- Correctness of implemented algorithms and logic
- Quality of code (structure, comments, naming conventions, etc.)
- Performance and optimization efforts
- Efficient use of external libraries when needed
- Problem-solving creativity and originality

Now let's dive into the tasks!
