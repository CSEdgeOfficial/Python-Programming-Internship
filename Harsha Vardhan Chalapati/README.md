TASK-1:Image Converter
    Write a program that accepts images in multiple formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF) and converts them into a desired format using Python Imaging Library (PIL).
Task-2:Data Analysis with Pandas
    Load the "Iris" dataset from Seaborn and analyze it using Pandas. Perform exploratory data analysis, cleaning, aggregation, visualizations, and correlation calculations.
TASK-3:Linear Regression with Scikit-learn
    Apply linear regression to predict house prices from the Boston housing dataset using scikit-learn. Compare train and test scores and plot residuals.
Task-4:Image Compression
    Develop a Python tool for compressing images while maintaining quality.Explore compression techniques like RLE and DCT.Allow users to adjust compression quality, support various image formats, and provide output options.
    Optionally, include a user interface. Ensure code modularity, performance optimization, and test with diverse images, along with comprehensive documentation
